## This is a simple web-terminal written by typescript and react
If you want to use it, first use the `cd` command to go to the `src` directory, then use the `node server.js` command to start the backend service.

Finally, you can go back to the project directory and start the front-end web page with the familiar `npm start` command.

> Oh, and don't forget to install the dependencies first with the `npm install` command :)
